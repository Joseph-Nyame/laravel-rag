Laravel RAG Service is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application designed to seamlessly integrate intelligent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities into your Laravel applications. By providing a simple API, this service allows developers to feed data, query it with natural language, perform actionable commands, and gain insights through trends and system analysisâ€”all without managing complex embeddings or vector searches. Built for scalability and ease of use, it abstracts the heavy lifting so you can focus on enhancing your app with AI-driven features.
Overview

The Laravel RAG Service empowers developers to add advanced AI functionalities to their applications through a lightweight, customizable package. It leverages Qdrant for efficient vector storage and the Laravel OpenAI package for natural language processing, delivering a plug-and-play solution for modern apps. Whether you're building a CRM, documentation platform, or e-commerce system, this service makes it easy to ingest data, query it intelligently, manage it dynamically, and derive actionable insights.
Project Stages

The development of Laravel RAG Service is planned in three stages, each adding powerful capabilities:

    Query Searches and Responses
        Core functionality to ingest data via API and answer natural language queries with context-aware responses.
        Example: Upload product manuals and ask, "How do I fix error 403?" to get precise answers.

    Trends, Recommendations, and System Analysis
        Analyze query patterns to provide trends and recommendations within your application.
        Offer system analysis support to optimize performance and suggest improvements.
        Example: Identify frequently asked questions to recommend new features or highlight underperforming content.
    Agent to Agent 
        Connect multiple aganet in  your app to produce a broad scope of anaylsis



Use Cases

    Documentation Platforms: Query manuals or guides with natural language and keep data in sync.
    E-Commerce: Answer customer queries about products and recommend items based on trends.
    CRMs: Enhance customer support with intelligent responses and system analysis.
    Content Management: Analyze user queries to optimize content and suggest improvements.

Tech Stack

    Laravel: Backend framework for robust API and service management.
    Qdrant: Vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
    //mkdir qdrant_storage
   // docker run -p 6333:6333 -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant
    Laravel OpenAI Package: Integration with OpenAI for natural language processing and generation.
